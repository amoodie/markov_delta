% in this code we evaluate the markov model in a single stratigraphic column

%% make pdfs from deposit data



%% make matrix of probabilities


%% evaluate the model 1 time
RSLR = 0.25; % need to make sure to add RSLR on each step to make a net aggradation


%% evaluate 1000 times and compute stats
