% in this code we evaluate the markov model in a single stratigraphic column


%% evaluate the model 1 time
RSLR = 0.25; % need to make sure to add RSLR on each step to make a net aggradation
BL = 0; % base level
z = 0; % random value for initial from within interval
for t = 1:900
    % look at column index for current z
    % generate a random number in interval [0 1]
    % determine which prob bin it falls in to
    % go that far in z
    % as RSLR in z
    
    
end



%% evaluate 1000 times and compute stats
